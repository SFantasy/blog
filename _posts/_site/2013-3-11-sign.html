<p>Having used <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSUSE'>openSUSE</a> 12.2 for nearly 1 week and being suffered from crash, I downloaded <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_mint'>Linux Mint</a> and then installed it immediately.</p>

<p>This reason is not convincing, however, I tried my best to rescue it and failed(nvidia driver may caused it).</p>

<p>Since I started to use GNU/Linux, a door of Open Source opened to me and the spirit of Freedom hit me. I am curious to try different Linux distributions and happy to find things interesting in them. YinWang did influenced me most(though he posted a <a href='http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_5d90e82f0101ip7f.html'>blog</a> in a opposite method several day ago).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not an expert in Operating Systems, but I do have rich experience in using them(especially GNU/Linux and M$ Windows).</p>

<p>Here I don&#8217;t want to talk anything about the advantages and disadvantages about them. GNU/Linux makes me comfortable except the X-windows( and it must be the main reason people hate it and not eager ot use it). Not long ago, I heared that Ubuntu is developing its own desk environment instead of X-windows( T/F? ). That is amazing if it is true.</p>

<p>It is really a mess in my mind when I recall the memory of using different distributions. Let me stop it.</p>

<p>After all, Linux Mint is pretty good for me to use, it is simple and user-friendly. The KDE of Mint is the best one I ever used. One more thing, it is compatible with Ubuntu applications. And I didn&#8217;t find any problems using it until now.</p>

<p>I will use Linux Mint for the rest time of my college life.</p>

<p><em>but you know, once Linuxer have money, they will buy a Mac Book : )</em></p>
